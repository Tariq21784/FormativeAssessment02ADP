    <p><strong>Brief description:</strong></p>
    <p>This project aims to provide a step-by-step guide, with the aid of images, on how to develop a Product microservice using ASP.NET Core. The microservice can be constructed using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and Visual Studio 2017 or the latest technologies, which come with built-in support for ASP.NET Core. The microservice includes its own DBcontext and database, as well as an isolated repository, allowing for independent deployment of the service.</p>
