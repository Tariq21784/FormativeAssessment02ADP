Brief description explaining what your FA2 project aims to achieve:
This Project will provide a step-by-step guide, 
with the aid of images, on how to develop a Product microservice using ASP.NET Core. 
The microservice can be constructed using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and Visual Studio 2017 or the latest technologies, 
which come with built-in support for Asp.NET Core. 
The microservice includes its own DBcontext and database, 
as well as an isolated repository, 
allowing for independent deployment of the service.
